Swami Chinmayananda Saraswati (Svāmī Cinmayānanda Sarasvatī), born Balakrishna Menon on May 8, 1916, in Ernakulam, Kerala, was a prominent Hindu spiritual leader who founded the Chinmaya Mission in 1953 to disseminate Advaita Vedanta, Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, and other Hindu scriptures globally. Originally a journalist involved in India's independence movement, he transformed from skepticism to sannyasa under gurus Swami Sivananda and Tapovan Maharaj, delivering his first jñāna yajña lecture series in 1951, which drew massive crowds and laid the groundwork for his spiritual outreach. He authored 95 publications, lectured worldwide in English to appeal to the educated middle class and diaspora, and played a key role in founding the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) in 1964 as its first president.​

Early Life and Transformation
Born to judge Kutta Menon and Paru Kutty, who died young, Balakrishna was raised by his aunt and educated at schools in Kochi and Thrissur, earning degrees from Maharaja's College, St. Thomas College, and Lucknow University in arts, law, and literature. During the 1942 Quit India Movement, he distributed leaflets, went underground, and was imprisoned in 1944, emerging to work as a journalist for The National Herald under Jawaharlal Nehru's influence, writing provocative pieces on socialism and society. In 1947, intending to expose sadhus, he visited Swami Sivananda's ashram in Rishikesh, where the guru's presence shifted his worldview; initiated into sannyasa on Mahashivratri 1949 as Swami Chinmayananda ("bliss of pure Consciousness"), he studied Vedanta intensely under Tapovan Maharaj in Uttarkashi.​

Founding Chinmaya Mission
Disillusioned by diluted Hindu practices during a 1951 all-India tour, Chinmayananda launched public jñāna yajñas—immersive lecture series on scriptures—starting in Pune, attracting thousands across castes and inaugurating inclusivity in rituals. After his 1953 Madras yajña, devotees formed the Chinmaya Mission (meaning "pure Knowledge" in Sanskrit), despite his initial reluctance against institutionalization; it grew to over 300 centers worldwide, offering study groups, women's Devi groups, and youth programs like Chinmaya Yuva Kendra (CHYK) for ages 18-30 and Bala Vihar for children. By 1956, President Rajendra Prasad endorsed his 23rd Delhi yajña; from 1965, global tours spanned 18 countries, with Chinmaya Mission West coordinating U.S. efforts by 1975, fostering interfaith ties like inaugurations by Cardinal Valerian Gracias and visits from the Dalai Lama.​

Role in Vishva Hindu Parishad
In 1963, amid RSS collaborations like funding Vivekananda Rock Memorial, Chinmayananda proposed a World Hindu Council to counter cultural erosion and Christian conversions announced during the Pope's 1964 India visit—he vowed to reconvert more, prompting a Sandeepany ashram conference with RSS pracharak S.S. Apte that birthed VHP. As inaugural president, he aimed to "awaken Hindus to their proud place" and "convert Hindus to Hinduism," emphasizing diaspora education on cultural duties; he backed 1980s Ekatmata Yatras for unity and, in 1992 Frankfurt, urged reclaiming Babri Masjid's Hindu pillars amid Ayodhya tensions, later defending its demolition akin to the Berlin Wall while prioritizing Rama's ideals. VHP marked his legacy at its 1993 events.​

Legacy and Institutions
Chinmayananda's innovations included the BMI (Body-Mind-Intellect) Chart for Vedantic self-analysis and ashrams like Sandeepany for retreats. Chinmaya Mission now runs 76+ Vidyalayas, colleges like Chinmaya Vishwavidyapeeth, a 200-bed Bangalore hospital, rural CORD programs, 58 temples, and environmental initiatives like Sikkim's Smriti Vanam. Post-1993 Mahasamadhi in San Diego (aged 77, after heart issues), successors Swami Tejomayananda and Swami Swaroopananda led expansions; tributes included 1991's suvarṇa tulābhāram gold ritual and 2015's ₹20 commemorative coin by Narendra Modi. Honors encompassed UN's "Planet in Crisis" address, Hinduism Today's 1992 award, and planned roles at 1993's Parliament of World's Religions centenary. His English works, translated widely, and 2014 biopic On a Quest sustain a renaissance reaching millions
