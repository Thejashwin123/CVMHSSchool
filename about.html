        <h1>About school</h1>
            <p>Chinmaya School generally refers to the group of Chinmaya Vidyalayas operated by the Central Chinmaya Mission Trust (CCMT), founded by Swami Chinmayananda. These schools emphasize a balanced education integrating modern academic excellence with traditional spiritual and moral values. There are over 80 Chinmaya Vidyalayas across India and one in Trinidad. They offer a holistic curriculum designed to nurture well-rounded individuals, focusing on moral integrity, discipline, patriotism, and intellectual growth.</p>
            <p>The first Chinmaya Vidyalaya started with a nursery school in Kollengode, Kerala in 1965 and has since expanded widely. The schools cater to diverse regions, from metropolitan cities to rural areas, with a commitment to inclusive education and community involvement. Chinmaya International Residential School (CIRS) in Coimbatore is a prominent example, offering CBSE and IB curricula on a large, scenic, and spiritually oriented campus.</p>
            <p>Chinmaya Vidyalaya Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Vadavalli, Coimbatore, is a distinguished co-educational school affiliated with the Tamil Nadu Board of Secondary Education (TNBSE). Established under the Chinmaya Mission, the school offers education from Nursery to Class 12, encompassing both matriculation and higher secondary levels.</p>
            <p>The school focuses on academic excellence through a well-rounded curriculum that balances rigorous subject learning with value-based education inspired by the Chinmaya Vision Programme. Alongside core subjects, students engage in sports, music, arts, dance, and other co-curricular activities to promote holistic development. The infrastructure includes spacious classrooms, well-equipped science and computer labs, a vast library, and sports facilities to support learning and physical growth.</p>
            <p>Chinmaya Vidyalaya Vadavalli emphasizes nurturing confident, disciplined, and culturally rooted individuals. It actively involves parents in the educational process through strong communication and meetings. The school creates a safe and secure learning environment with CCTV surveillance and provides a platform for students to excel academically, ethically, and socially, preparing them well for higher education and future challenges.</p>
