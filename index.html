            <h3>CHINMAYA VIDYALAYA</h3>
            <p>Chinmaya School generally refers to the group of Chinmaya Vidyalayas operated by the Central Chinmaya Mission Trust (CCMT), founded by Swami Chinmayananda. These schools emphasize a balanced education integrating modern academic excellence with traditional spiritual and moral values. There are over 80 Chinmaya Vidyalayas across India and one in Trinidad. They offer a holistic curriculum designed to nurture well-rounded individuals, focusing on moral integrity, discipline, patriotism, and intellectual growth.</p>
            <p>The first Chinmaya Vidyalaya started with a nursery school in Kollengode, Kerala in 1965 and has since expanded widely. The schools cater to diverse regions, from metropolitan cities to rural areas, with a commitment to inclusive education and community involvement. Chinmaya International Residential School (CIRS) in Coimbatore is a prominent example, offering CBSE and IB curricula on a large, scenic, and spiritually oriented campus.</p>
